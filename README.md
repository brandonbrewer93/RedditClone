# RedditClone

This project was built for the January session of Code Louisville's C#/.NET track. It was built to mimic Reddit, and to develop
a more thorough understanding of ASP.NET and relational databases.

## Project Highlights:

* Full CRUD capabilities
* Account creation
* User Authentication and Authorization
* Fully responsive to different device sizes

## Instructions:

1. Clone and open the project with Visual Studio.
2. In the Solution Explorer, right-click on the solution and select *Restore NuGet Packages*.
3. Open the Package Manager Console by going to *Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console*.
4. In the Package Manager Console enter `Update-Database`.
5. Build and Run the project with the F5 key.
6. When the project opens, register as a new user to gain full CRUD capabilities.

*Note: If you have recently ran an app with that uses a similar authentication method, there is a chance that you could already be logged
in when you first start the app. If this is the case, you will experience errors due to your account not existing in the database. If you
find that you are already logged in, just logout and register as a new user.*
